# Environments
A facility for managing multiple development environments, supporting customization of each one for things like "AWS",
Python, etc.  The core of the system is a set of standard entry/exit scripts and a modular .config directory in each 'environment'.

# Installation
Environments can be placed anywhere, typical configuration is your home directory ( ~/environments ).  This project may
be enlisted there (please fork), or just downloaded & copied there.  If you fork and create your own github project, you
can save all of your environment configuration scripts in github.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jim-cooley/environments.git
cp environments ~/environments
cd ~/environments
```

# Contributing

# License
The license is GPL3 to encourage contributing back changes.  Please contact me if there is an issue with this, i'm not interested
in most of the GPL3 provisions other than this.
